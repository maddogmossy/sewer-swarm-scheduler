We have a reproducible layout bug in our Scheduler UI that only occurs inside the Replit preview environment. I’m attaching two screenshots showing the issue:

Sidebar collapsed → layout works correctly

Sidebar expanded → layout breaks

Operative + Assistant cards stop wrapping

Cards refuse to switch between horizontal and vertical orientation

Address/job details no longer expand to full width

Flexbox responsiveness stops functioning entirely

What We Have Confirmed

This is not a CSS or table-layout conflict.

The Scheduler page uses a container with Flexbox + Tailwind responsive breakpoints that work perfectly in isolation and work perfectly in the Outlook-style calendar page, which uses almost the same layout structure.

However, in the Scheduler page:

When the sidebar is expanded, the parent container fails to propagate width changes

The layout engine reports stale dimensions to child components

Tailwind breakpoints (md:, lg:) stop activating

Flexbox items behave as if they have infinite horizontal space

Cards never wrap, even when forced with min-w-0, flex-1, or basis-auto

The Address panel refuses to expand despite correct w-full + flex-grow rules

This behaviour is identical to a ResizeObserver not firing or a hydration boundary blocking width propagation

Why This Is Not a Table Issue

Although <table> is used deeper in the CalendarGrid, the broken elements (OperativeCard, AssistantCard, Address UI) are not inside table cells.

Also:

Table expansion would cause overflow or horizontal scrolling

It would NOT cause Flexbox breakpoints to stop working

It would NOT cause .flex-col → .flex-row to fail

It would NOT cause differences between collapsed sidebar vs open sidebar

The width-propagation failure directly coincides with opening the sidebar component, which indicates:

Likely Causes

A hydration/suspense boundary breaking layout measurement

A parent container that never recalculates width after sidebar toggle

Virtualized container interfering with intrinsic size

The preview iframe not dispatching a resize event

A ResizeObserver not firing when the sidebar changes width

SSR hydration mismatch locking the layout

What Needs Auditing

Please perform an audit on:

The parent container of the Scheduler page

The render boundary around the sidebar + main grid

Whether React hydration is interfering with measurement

Whether ResizeObserver fires when the sidebar width changes

Whether the preview environment is failing to propagate a resize event

Whether the editor iframe uses content-box vs border-box sizing

The goal is to ensure that the Scheduler page receives correct, real-time width information so its Flexbox + Tailwind responsive layout can reflow correctly.

Expected Layout (Works When Sidebar Is Collapsed)

Operative/Assistant appear side-by-side when width allows

They automatically stack vertically in narrow constraints

Address UI expands fully under them

Calendar cards wrap gracefully

Actual Layout When Sidebar Expands (Bug)

Operative/Assistant lock into horizontal mode

No wrapping

No breakpoint activation

Address UI stays cramped

The entire responsive system stops firing

This matches a container measurement bug, not a CSS bug.

Thank you — we need a full audit on this so we can proceed with production deployment.
